# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise is a playwright that is using Kickstarters to fund her theater projects. Using data pulled from Kickstarter, I provided advise to Louise on how to launch a Kickstarter for the highest chance of success. Following her Kickstarter, Louise was curious how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose

The purpose of the first part of the project is to identify trends in Kickstarter outcome (success, canceled, or failed) compared to launch date. The purpose of the second part of the project is to identify trends in Kickstarter outcome (success, canceled, or failed) compared to the initial Kickstarter goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One of the challenges of this project was making sure that every data point was accounted for. To ensure I wasn't missing any data points, I created a table of reference values to check that my =COUNTIF() formulas were catching everything that I needed them to catch. 

Reference table:

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
