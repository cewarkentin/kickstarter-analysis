# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
We are partnered with Louise, a U.S. playwright hoping to use a kickstarter to fund her project. Using data from the Kickstarter website, Microsoft Excel was used to uncover trends related to the success of various Kickstarters. These statistics are useful to help Louise launch her own Kickstarter with the highest chance for success.
