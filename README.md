# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
We are partnered with Louise, a U.S. playwright hoping to use a kickstarter to fund her project. Using data from the Kickstarter website, Microsoft Excel was used to uncover trends related to the success of various Kickstarters. These statistics are useful to help Louise launch her own Kickstarter with the highest chance for success. 
Our first job was to familiarize ourselves with the kickstarter data and make sure it was in a readable/usable/interpretable format.
Additionally, conditional formatting was used to provide at-a-glance information. 
Additionally, we split the category column into two different columns: Main category and subcategory. Doing so allowed us to compare kickstarter performance against projects such as a similar play titled "Foresight" that most similarly represented Louise's project.
Then we used pivot tables and pivot charts to analyze the provided data.
First we looked at how successful theater kickstarters were in general.
We additionally looked at how campaign length correlated with outcome. There were the most successful Kickstarters launched in May. The number of canceled campaigns appears relatively consistent regardless of launch month, but most failed campaigns launched in January, June, July or October.
Finally, in order to set a realistic and likely successful Kickstarter goal, we used descriptive statistics to compare differences between successful and failed Kickstarters for theater plays.
